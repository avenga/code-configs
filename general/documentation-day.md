# Documentation Day

## Goals of the Documentation Day

The general idea is that every project has a regular day when the documentation is checked. The goal is to have **well maintained documentations with all necessary and up-to-date information**.

The main goal of the Documentation Day is to **establish and maintain confidence in the documentation**.

## Where to Start

Assigning all involved developers to execute a Documentation Day, one after another, is a good idea. Introducing new developers by having them execute the Documentation Day will provide great insight and valuable feedback, as well as asking developers who are not involved in the project.

The following steps are one possible way for the Documentation Day:

1. Read the readme and contributing file to get a brief overview
2. Setup the project
3. Take an arbitrary task and start adding a feature or fixing a bug
4. Check the related documentation (if already exist).

An alternative might be to focus on the documentation of a specific feature.

1. Ask any project member to name three arbitrary features
2. Select your favourite dice and roll ...
3. Read the documentation of the feature your dice has chosen
4. Check for inconsistencies and incomprehensions.

If possible, fix all identified problems directly and update the documentation regardingly. Otherwise try to schedule the issues to have them fixed at least until the next Documentation Day.

## Necessity, Frequency and Duration

The lifespan of a project, the frequency of code contributions as well as the number of contributors are factors for the necessity and frequency of a Documentation Day. If the development from start to finish is about 3 weeks or code contributions are not regular enough, a Documentation Day is not necessary. In this case the documentation should be checked as part of the QA phase.

If the number of developers contributing code 

* **is 2** a Documentation Day should be planed every **4 weeks**,
* **is up to 6** a Documentation Day should be planed every **3 weeks** and
* **is larger than 6** a Documentation Day should be planed **within the sprint cycle**.

When doing documentation days do them time boxed. One hour is a good starting point. Within this period do whatever you can do. You donâ€™t have to create or change the whole documentation at once. Eat slowly, bite after bite.
