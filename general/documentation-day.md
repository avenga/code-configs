# Documentation Day

## Goals of the Documentation Day

The general idea is that every project has a regular day when the documentation is checked. The goal is to have **well maintained documentations with all necessary and up-to-date information**.

The main goal of the Documentation Day is to **establish and maintain confidence in the documentation**.

## Necessity, Frequency and Duration

The lifespan of a project, the frequency of code contributions as well as the number of contributors are factors for the necessity and frequency of a Documentation Day. If the development from start to finish is about 3 weeks or code contributions are not regular enough, a Documentation Day is not necessary. In this case the documentation should be checked as part of the QA phase.

If the number of developers contributing code 

* **is 2** a Documentation Day should be planed every **4 weeks**,
* **is up to 6** a Documentation Day should be planed every **3 weeks** and
* **is larger than 6** a Documentation Day should be planed **within the sprint cycle**.

When doing documentation days do them time boxed. One hour is a good starting point. Within this period do whatever you can do. You donâ€™t have to create or change the whole documentation at once. Eat slowly, bite after bite.
